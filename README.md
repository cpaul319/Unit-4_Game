###Crystals Collector

## Simple One page Game

*There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
*The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

*When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 


*Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
*When they do click one, update the player's score counter.


   *The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
   *The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

*The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.


*When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.


*The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.


 ##Overview

In this assignment, I created a fun and interactive game for web browsers. This time, the app dynamically updates the users HTML pages with the jQuery library.
